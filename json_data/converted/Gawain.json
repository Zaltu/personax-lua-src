He is a friend to young knights, a defender of the poor, and as \"the Maidens' Knight\", a defender of women as well. It is said his strength waxes and wanes with the sun; in the most common form of this motif, his might triples by noon, but fades as the sun sets. His knowledge of herbs made him a great healer, and he is credited with at least three children: Florence, Lovell, and Gingalain."}
