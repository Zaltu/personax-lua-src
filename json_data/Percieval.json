He is most commonly known for retrieving Excalibur from a clan of mischievous faery creatures, whose only distinguishing characteristics were their brightly colored headwear and small stature. This eventually led to the present day Anglo-Saxon folklore of garden gnomes. Sir Percival has been many times recorded as one of the knights bearing witness to the Holy Grail."}
