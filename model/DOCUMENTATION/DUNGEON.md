# Overview
Dungeon is another example of a pseudo "sub-class" of an existing context. In this case, freeroam. There is actually only one main difference between freeroam and and dungeon, which is the ability to "attack" the space in front of you in order to engage in combat. Theoretically, the actual entering of the battle space could be handled by the UE actor built-in Lua call (thing I have yet to try to implement), but it seems more sanitized to do it as part of the dungeon's input processing.

### Input Handling and Responsibility
While most inputs will have no effect, when an enemy is struck by the player or an enemy strikes the player in the dungeon context, C++ should fire an event with a powerlevel key corresponding to the powerlevel of the enemy (more on that in the dungeon env doc and the battle doc). This will launch the battle context. Since the interaction causing the event is entirely in UE, and the loaded env doesn't actually change on loading the battle "arena" within a single dungeon (see C++ doc, eventually), it is C++'s responsibility both to save the location of the player before the battle context launches, and to return there once the battle is over.
