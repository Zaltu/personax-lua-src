# Overview
God knows there's a long was to go on this yet.

A few major important plot points to start off:
- Awakening/Discovery of first dungeon
- Velvet Room design
- Plot twist
- Final Boss
- True Final Boss
- 
- What do with Sister character?

## Dungeon Design and Presentation
It may be cool, instead of having the single gate at the entrance with the reference to Dante's Inferno, to have individual biblical quotes refering to each of the sins at their dungeon entrance. EG. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned; Though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil; etc...

## Party Member SL Evolution
Unlike P4 and P5, I'm not fixed on having every party member have their own Social Link if not necessary, or having the evolution or their Persona be linked to the completion of the Social Link. Notably, the Fool social link is generally the party as a whole's social link, meaning that further social links pertaining to the main story directly are definitely redundant. I enjoyed the self-realization arcs the characters had in P3 for the evolution of their persona as a representation of the change in their "valor" based on the realignment of their reason for fighting. That being said, I'm not in any way *against* party member social links, so long as they represent bonds completely independant of the main story line.


## Plot twist
One of the better, earlier ideas I had about the plot twist was that the main character in fact is acused of going from Limbo to the sin of treachery based on the fact that his interactions with each social link are often "chosen" by the player to reflect what they think the person wants to hear (so as to gain points and progress).

This could go either way. In reality, that's not the case as demonstrated by the fact that he can wield the Personas of those arcanas well, meaning that they are a facet of his _true_ self. The player could either "admit" to the allegations, effectively making them true (and potentially breaking or de-evolving teammate social links?) and leading to a bad ending, or denying the allegations leading to the support of the team and confronting Legion.


## (True) Final Boss
MARK 1  
In the vein of having multiple faces being a good/bad thing, the initial Final Boss was meant to be Legion, for he is many. Using Satan/Lucifer as the boss of hell is kind of overdone anyway, and with the vague idea in mind that both God and the Devil are suppose to be "neutral" entities judging people fairly, there's perhaps no real reason to bring them into this.
Having Legion impersonate Lucifer in the circle of Fraud would also be potentially kino.

Something to keep in mind in all this as well is that the Final Boss is generally supposed to be related to the whole Shadow/Persona concept. Meaning that it should be probably be motivated by something that is present in most people, but often not brought to light, or perhaps not discussed.

It could perhaps be explained through the idea that as more people descended to hell "fairly", Legion amassed more and more being to himself, and the whole Jungiang aspect integrates into that society as a whole judges people very harshly for how arbitrary circumstance can be. It remains to be seen if that would actually be the mindset of most people that would end up in hell in the first place though. He may have to get this from elsewhere...

Maybe even the party members themselves? Who felt they were judged unfairly? If that's the case...

Legion couldn't be the True Final Boss, since the team would be pulled into this world and this fight because of something they deemed unfair in the first place. With that in mind though, DO NO MAKE THE PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING, that's just shit storytelling and will make the player feel annoyed if they see it coming.


MARK 2  
I realize that the setting of the dungeons of the game isn't actually meant to be "real" hell, just a metaphorical representation of the good and evil people see in each other based on the limited interactions most people have with each other. In that vein, the idea that legion poses an arbitrary evil entity like Lucifer as the Fraud boss, while himself being the Treachery boss is perhaps possible.

Then the big brain mind games come in. if we are trying to set up Legion as being the "secret true final boss", then we don't want the player to notice that there's still another boss/more story left. Unfortunatly, presenting each dungeon as a circle of hell makes it glaringly obvious to anyone with half a brain. On the other hand, if we pose (not)Lucifer as the final boss, it could ostensibly make sense to have designed the *7 deadly sins* as dungeons, then placed Lucifer at the end because why not. And then the jebait with dungeons 8 and 9 revealing the true nature of the place.

There are a number of problematic things with that though, both since the deadly sins and the circles of hell don't actually match... It would be extremely difficult to design each dungeon in such a way that it could be interpreted as both. It may be an interesting challenge though. I would also have to remove the whole "abandon all hope yee who enter here" premise in the dungeon hub.

Overall, I think Legion as the True Final Boss is a great idea. I just need to figure out how to set it up.

MARK 3  
I should remind myself of this since it already slipped my mind: There are *two* main plotlines in mind for the game: the "plot twist" where it turns out the MC is the sinner of treachery and the main initial plot where people are being judged harshly by someone/something the party feels does not have the authority to do so.

MARK 4  
We don't want to over-emphesize *any* of the sins, especially at the start and especially since erotisism is such a powerful theme. In the same vein, we really don't want to separate each party member into joining for "their" sin (though some could), since too many would end up joining too late in the story.

We also don't want anyone to be overly linked with multiple sins, or cause ludo-narrative dissonance between Social Links and the main story and since the MC is accused of treachery, he probably shouldn't be the representative of Limbo.

AND SO, the sister is actually the representative of Limbo, though you're *both* dragged to the *sorting* area, but get saved by your starting members. These starting members would be the first sinners of the next dungeons, but we don't need to present them as much, as we're entering these dungeons *not* for their sake, but to save *others*.

-> P3 starts with MC, Junpei Yukari and Mitsuru on Nav  
-> P4 starts with MC, Yosuke, Chie and Teddy on Nav  
-> P5 starts with MC, Ryuji and Morgana(+Nav), though Ann joins very quickly  
So each with ~3 chars + Nav, which would equate to  
-> PX starts with MC, Sister, Lust and Gluttony on Nav where __sister is Limbo__

With this detachment in mond, while most party members would have to be "sinful" in some way, they actually do not *need* to be explicitelty linked to any one circle. Which means the starting party doesn't *need* to include Lust and Gluttony.
