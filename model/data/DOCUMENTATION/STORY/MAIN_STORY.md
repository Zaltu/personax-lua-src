# Overview
God knows there's a long was to go on this yet.

A few major important plot points to start off:
- Awakening/Discovery of first dungeon
- Plot twist
- Final Boss
- True Final Boss
- 
- What do with Sister character?


## Plot twist
One of the better, earlier ideas I had about the plot twist was that the main character in fact is acused of going from Limbo to the sin of treachery based on the fact that his interactions with each social link are often "chosen" by the player to reflect what they think the person wants to hear (so as to gain points and progress).

This could go either way. In reality, that's not the case as demonstrated by the fact that he
Legion couldn't be the True Final Boss, since the team would be pulled into this world and this fight because of something they deemed unfair in the first place. With that in mind though, DO NO MAKE THE PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING, that's just shit storytelling and will make the player feel annoyed if they see it coming.

 can wield the Personas of those arcanas well, meaning that they are a facet of his _true_ self. The player could either "admit" to the allegations, effectively making them true (and potentially breaking or de-evolving teammate social links?) and leading to a bad ending, or denying the allegations leading to the support of the team and confronting Legion.

## (True) Final Boss
In the vein of having multiple faces being a good/bad thing, the initial Final Boss was meant to be Legion, for he is many. Using Satan/Lucifer as the boss of hell is kind of overdone anyway, and with the vague idea in mind that both God and the Devil are suppose to be "neutral" entities judging people fairly, there's perhaps no real reason to bring them into this.
Having Legion impersonate Lucifer in the circle of Fraud would also be potentially kino.

Something to keep in mind in all this as well is that the Final Boss is generally supposed to be related to the whole Shadow/Persona concept. Meaning that it should be probably be motivated by something that is present in most people, but often not brought to light, or perhaps not discussed.

It could perhaps be explained through the idea that as more people descended to hell "fairly", Legion amassed more and more being to himself, and the whole Jungiang aspect integrates into that society as a whole judges people very harshly for how arbitrary circumstance can be. It remains to be seen if that would actually be the mindset of most people that would end up in hell in the first place though. He may have to get this from elsewhere...

Maybe even the party members themselves? Who felt they were judged unfairly? If that's the case...
