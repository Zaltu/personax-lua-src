# Overview
Ideas and planning of "forced" events/cutscenes throughout the game.


## Staples
A couple staple events included in most games like this would be the school trip event. Assuming this is still set in pseudo-japan, I'm not sure where I should send them...

Each party member should have an arc that ties into the main story, most likely resulting in the evolution of their Persona. In both 3 and 5, a character is added to the party only temporarily. I don't think I want to *force* that into the design though.

Since it is a school, EXAM WEEKS are a thing. While those may not count as "events" proper, it's important to plan them appropriately.
