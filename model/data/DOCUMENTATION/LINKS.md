# Overview
There's technically 22 arcanas in a standard tarot deck. Persona historically also includes one arcana from the Aelph deck as well, that being Aeon, and P4G also included "Jester" or something idk.

While that would normally mean there are 23 social links to write, there are a number of arcanas that are generally reserved for story progression. These always include Fool, Judgement and World, and sometimes a smattering of others.

There are a few other special social links in the form of the links established between the player and his teamates. These are not forced progession like the story-driven ones, but are important none-the-less as they must tie in to the main plot and the purpose of each character within it.


As a particularly important note, I really need to decide on what the Sister's SL/Arcana/Story purpose is going to be. I'm dedicated to including that now.


## STORY-DRIVEN
For Persona X, the current list of STORY-DRIVEN arcanas is:
- Fool
- Judgement
- World


## TEAMMATE
Most teammates are associated with a certain Circle of Hell in Persona X, and each circle is tied in to an arcana. This is a breakdown of the current link between circles, arcanas and teammates:
- Limbo     - Fool          - MC (NA)
- Lust      - Empress       - TBD
- Gluttony  - Chariot       - TBD
- Greed     - Emperor       - TBD
- Anger     - Hermit        - TBD
- Heresy    - Hierophant    - TBD
- Violence  - Magician      - TBD
- Fraud     - Priestess     - TBD
- Treachery - Judgement     - MC (NA)


## Others. Determined and Ideas
Here are the development notes on thoughts and ideas about each Social Links and what their stories should be.


### Temperance
This idea was built around rank 10 of the reverse route, being that you get a text forbodding of the link committing suicide. It evloved to someone in the photography club being somehow overzealous (or something?) about their club and going overboard, until all they worked for was destroyed. They then send a text with a picture of a noose. I _think_ the idea was orifinally born from thinking about ranking up a Social Link without the person actually being present.


### Aeon
Aeon being the Aelph version of World, I thought it would be fitting for it to be about someone deciding to follow their own path. Since a lot needs to build up to this, so it doesn't seem rushed, it would have had to either be a character we interact with throughout the game like a teammate (as was the case for Aigis in P3FES), or someone we already knew. Since Persona X was meant to be set between the events of P3 and P4, Elizabeth being the person to decide to leave the Velvet Room and persue a way of freeing P3MC, as she is known to have done though P4A, etc, seemed fitting. It does mean that another Velvet Room assistant will have to be designed, and may end up not being as fleshed out as they perhaps should. We will see.
