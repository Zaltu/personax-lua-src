A Day represents the various available time period within a single day. They are all orgianized as a lua table-list of timeslots.
The available timeslots are defined in the "daystates.lua" file. They are:
  - Early Morning
  - Morning
  - Lunchtime
  - Afternoon
  - After School
  - Evening
  - Late Night
  - Daytime
Daytime is a semantically unique case as it represents the whole day outside of the Morning/Afternoon breakdown. It should only really be used on days with no school.

The daystate does not affect the particulars of the context change event of passing time, only the generic, mostly graphic and flag-related differences between each state. The entry in the Day table-list itself defines what context to load following the entry into that time period.
This means that each time period of each Day MUST match one of the following situations. If not, a crash will occur:
 - Be empty. This will cause the day to be skipped
 - Call a cutscene or other event that ends with time moving forward (defined in the actions=<context> key)
 - Have a environment and context specified in the env=<env>/context=<context> keys
