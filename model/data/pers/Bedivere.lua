Only he and Arthur survived the Battle of Camlan. In the early legends he is the cupbearer. Later legends have him as the one who returns Arthur's sword Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. He then put the dying Arthur in a boat to take him to Avalon. In some legends Arthur gives him rule over Normandy]]
