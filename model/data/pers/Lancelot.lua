He was raised by the Lady of the Lake, hence his title Lancelot Du Lac. Sir Lancelot was the only knight known to defeat King Arthur during a jousting match. While his legend lives on as perhaps the greatest of all the knights, he crossed swords and words with both his fellow knights and the King himself many times. While questing for the Holy Grail, he was deemed unworthy and could not approach it, though his son, Sir Galahad, could.]]
