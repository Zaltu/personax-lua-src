This led to a number of tense situations between the two knights who, otherwise, respected and admired each other. Among other offences, Sir Palamedes kidnapped Isolde after returning to safety her maid whom he had found lost in the forest. On this occasion, as in others, Tristram and Palamedes clashed in battle over Isolde's love. After these conflicts, the two knights were generally reconciled but always remained bitter.]]
